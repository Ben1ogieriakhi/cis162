  <h1>About Me</h1>
 
  <p>
    Hi, my name is Aisosa. I'm currently working toward earning my associate degree. I'm excited to learn and grow in this course. 
    My main goal is to graduate with my associate degree and use what I learn to build a solid foundation for my career. 
    In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends and playing video games. It helps me relax and unwind. 
    No, I don’t have any previous experience in this topic, but I’m eager to learn. 
    My goal is to understand how everything works in this field so I can apply the knowledge to future jobs and be more confident in what I do.
  </p>
